Notes for BIND 9.17.18
----------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Native PKCS#11 support has been removed; BIND 9 now uses OpenSSL engine_pkcs11 from the
  OpenSC project. :gl:`#2691`

- The ``masterfile-format`` format ``map`` has removed.  If you are using the
  ``map`` format, you are advised to convert the zones to ``raw`` format with
  ``named-compilezone`` and change the configuration prior to BIND 9
  upgrade. :gl:`#2882`

- Remove old-style DLZ drivers that had to be enabled in ``named`` during the
  compile time.  The new-style dynamically loaded DLZ modules should be used
  as a replacement. :gl:`#2814`

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``named`` and ``named-checkconf`` now issue a warning when there is a single
  configured port in the ``query-source``, ``transfer-source``,
  ``notify-source``, and ``parental-source``, and/or in their respective IPv6 counterparts.
  :gl:`#2888`

- ``named`` and ``named-checkconf`` now return an error when the single configured
  port in the ``query-source``, ``transfer-source``, ``notify-source``,
  ``parental-source``, and/or their respective IPv6 counterparts clashes with the
  global listening port. This configuration is no longer supported as of BIND
  9.16.0 but no error was reported, although sending UDP messages
  (such as notifies) would fail. :gl:`#2888`

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- When new IP addresses were added to the system during ``named``
  startup, ``named`` failed to listen on TCP for the newly added
  interfaces. :gl:`#2852`

- Under specific circumstances, zone transfers over TCP and TLS could be
  interrupted prematurely. This has been fixed. :gl:`#2917`

- Doing a reload on a catalog zone which is referencing a missing/deleted zone
  was causing a crash. This has been fixed. :gl:`#2308`
