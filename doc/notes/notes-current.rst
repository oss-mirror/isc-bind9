Notes for BIND 9.17.18
----------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add support for HTTPS and SVCB record types. :gl:`#1132`

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Native PKCS#11 support has been removed; BIND 9 now uses OpenSSL engine_pkcs11 from the
  OpenSC project. :gl:`#2691`

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``dnssec-signzone`` is now able to retain signatures from inactive
  predecessor keys without introducing additional signatures from the successor
  key. This allows for a gradual replacement of RRSIGs as they reach expiry.
  :gl:`#1551`

- SHA-1 CDS records are no longer used by ``dnssec-cds`` to make DS
  records. Thanks to Tony Finch. :gl:`!2946`

- Zone transfers over TLS (XoT) now need "dot" Application-Layer Protocol
  Negotiation (ALPN) tag to be negotiated, as required by the RFC 9103.
  :gl: `#2794`

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- When following QNAME minimization, BIND could use a stale zonecut from cache 
  to resolve the query, resulting in a non-minimized query. This has been
  fixed :gl:`#2665`

- Migrate a single key to CSK when reconfiguring a zone to make use of
  'dnssec-policy' :gl:`#2857`

- A recent change to the internal memory structure of zone databases
  inadvertently neglected to update the MAPAPI value for ``map``-format
  zone files. This caused ``named`` to attempt to load files into memory
  that were no longer compatible, triggering an assertion failure on
  startup. The MAPAPI value has now been updated, so ``named`` will
  reject outdated files when encountering them. :gl:`#2872`
